## Hello there! 👋

I'm Rachel and have been working at the intersection of innovation and venture building across Asia-Pacific - primarily through my work at a venture studio Rainmaking APAC (now part of Bain & Company), where I led open innovation programs and helped structure ventures in agrifood, energy and climate tech.

My background blends strategy with delivery where I've...
| Example | Projects |
|-----:|---------------|
|     1| Launched a digital platform for smallholder farmers in the Philippines |
|     2| Spearheaded customer desirability for the development of a GenAI-enabled troubleshooting solution for car repair |
|     3| Mentored startups expanding across Southeast Asia |
|     4| Led corporate-startup pilots that unlocked operational savings |

What ties it all together is a deep focus on turning bold ideas into solutions that are not only viable, but grounded in systems thinking and local realities.

I'm most excited by opportunities that bring together so much of what drives me - entrepreneurship, collaboration, and real-world impact across sectors I care deeply about.

⚡ I've always been most energized... by fast-moving environments where I can take real ownership and build something with clear outcomes - balancing ambiguity, delivery and stakeholder alignment. That's what motivates me and enables me to thrive. 

🚀 I’m currently working on... something outside my day job by focusing on launching a marketplace enabling SMEs to access AI agents for their work whilst enabling AI Agent builders to monetize at www.indus.work

👩‍🏫 I’m currently learning to... accelerate my work and build with AI tools like Bolt.new
